## 5. Missing or Incomplete Features

1. **Better S3 Migration Path**:
   - The PRD mentions "Files stored in server folder (with future migration to S3 planned)"
   - While files are stored in the server folder, a more explicit abstraction layer for future S3 migration could be beneficial

2. **Document Detection for Duplicates**:
   - The PRD mentions "No automatic duplicate document detection (handled manually by consultant)"
   - This is correctly not implemented as specified, but could be considered as a future enhancement

## 6. Conclusion

The implementation now fully aligns with the PRD requirements. We've addressed all the key gaps that were identified:

1. ✅ Document history tracking for updatable documents
2. ✅ Employment date tracking with start and end dates
3. ✅ Enhanced case composition dashboard with detailed statistics
4. ✅ Bulk import of document types via CSV

A few minor areas could be further improved in future iterations:

1. Create a clearer abstraction layer for future S3 migration
2. Consider adding optional duplicate document detection as a future enhancement

Overall, the system now provides a comprehensive case management solution as specified in the PRD, with proper document history tracking, employment date tracking, enhanced dashboard statistics, and document type bulk import capabilities.
