# Implementation Changes Summary

This document outlines the changes made to align the project implementation with the PRD requirements.

## 1. Document History Tracking for Updatable Documents

As specified in the PRD, "for updatable documents, the system should keep a history". This feature was missing from the implementation. The following changes were made to implement this requirement:

### Database Schema Updates:
- Added version tracking fields to the `case_documents` table:
  - `is_current_version`: Boolean flag indicating if this is the current version
  - `version_number`: Integer tracking the version sequence
  - `replace_version_id`: Reference to the document this version replaces

- Created a new `document_version_history` table to store previous versions of documents:
  - Tracks document versions with version number, file path, and upload information
  - Maintains a complete history of document changes over time

### Code Implementation:
- Enhanced the `CaseDocumentInDB` model to include version tracking fields
- Added a new `DocumentVersionHistory` model to represent historical versions
- Updated `CaseDocumentWithTypeInfo` to include previous version information
- Implemented new methods:
  - `get_document_version_history`: Retrieves version history for a document
  - `add_document_to_version_history`: Archives a document version
  - Enhanced `update_case_document`: Now checks if a document is of type "updatable" and preserves history when the file is changed

These changes ensure that when a document of type "updatable" is modified, the previous version is preserved in the version history, allowing users to access older versions as needed.

## 2. Employment Date Tracking

The PRD specifies that employment history should include start and end dates. This was missing from the implementation. The following changes were made:

### Database Schema Updates:
- Added employment date fields to the `person_employment_history` table:
  - `employment_since`: The start date of employment (required)
  - `employment_until`: The end date of employment (optional)

### Code Implementation:
- Updated the `EmploymentHistoryBase` model to include the new date fields
- Modified `create_employment_history` and `update_employment_history` functions to handle the new fields
- Ensured proper date handling and validation throughout the employment history module

These changes provide the complete employment timeline information as specified in the PRD, allowing the system to properly track current and historical employment relationships.

## 3. Enhanced Case Composition Dashboard

The PRD mentions a comprehensive case composition dashboard showing counts of persons, companies, and financial entities, as well as document status. The implementation was missing some of these statistics.

### Enhanced Dashboard Statistics:
- Added additional status fields to the `EntityCounts` model:
  - `missing_required_documents`: Count of documents that are required but not provided
  - `pending_documents`: Count of documents that have been uploaded but are pending review

- Implemented sophisticated queries to calculate:
  - Required document status for all entity types
  - Incomplete entities (those missing required documents)
  - Document status breakdown by type and processing state

- Enhanced the `get_case_overview` method to provide comprehensive statistics:
  - Added complex SQL query to identify entities with missing required documents
  - Added tracking of document status to identify documents needing attention
  - Improved the dashboard data model to reflect all entity types as specified in the PRD

- Added detailed entity-level document status in the `get_detailed_case_overview` method:
  - Each entity now includes a list of its missing required documents
  - Improved document categorization by status and type
  - Entity counts are now properly aggregated and displayed

These enhancements provide a complete case composition overview as specified in the PRD, giving the mortgage consultant clear visibility into case status, document completeness, and pending action items.

## 4. API and Model Alignment

To ensure consistency between the API and the enhanced data models:

- Updated the Document API endpoints to handle version history:
  - Added the ability to retrieve document version history
  - Ensured proper versioning when documents are updated

- Aligned database models with Pydantic request/response models:
  - Made sure all API models correctly include the enhanced fields
  - Updated validation rules to enforce correct data formats

## 5. Migration Path for Implementation

These changes will require database migrations to add the new fields and tables. The migration path includes:

1. Adding the new fields to existing tables (version tracking for documents, employment dates)
2. Creating the new document version history table
3. Adding appropriate indexes for efficient queries
4. Setting default values for existing records

Since the system already includes the database migration capability through the `run_migrations()` function, these changes can be applied by adding the new schema elements to the migration process.

## Conclusion

These implementation changes bring the project into alignment with the PRD requirements. The system now properly supports:

- Document history for updatable documents
- Complete employment history tracking with start and end dates
- Comprehensive case overview dashboard with detailed entity and document statistics

These enhancements ensure that the mortgage consultant has the tools needed to efficiently manage case composition and document status, as specified in the PRD.
