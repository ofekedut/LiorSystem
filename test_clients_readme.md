- Personal identification documents (ID cards, passports, driver's licenses)
- Financial statements (bank statements, account details)
- Property documents (property registration, mortgage papers)
- Vehicle documents (car registration, insurance)
- Official reports and forms

## Usage for Testing

To test document type detection and processing functionality:

1. Select one of the client directories above
2. Use the documents within these directories as test files for upload to the system
3. Verify that the document types are correctly identified by the processing pipeline
4. Check that the system properly extracts relevant information from the documents

These test clients provide a diverse set of real-world documents to validate the system's ability to process different document types and structures.
