4. **Fixed Migrations Code**

## Testing Requirements

Before merging these changes, please:

1. Run all tests to ensure everything works correctly
2. Verify database migrations work properly
3. Check that all API endpoints work as expected

## Next Steps

1. The frontend should work with these changes as they now match the PRD requirements exactly.
2. Document management workflow might need some UX adjustments to handle the simplified document model.
3. Consider updating the PRD if any of the removed features are actually needed.

## Notes

All changes were made to strictly align with the PRD requirements. If there are features not in the PRD that should be included, the PRD should be updated first before adding those features back.
