## Methodology

The analysis involved examining the following project components:

- Database schema definitions and models
- API endpoints and routers

Each component was compared against the corresponding requirements in the PRD to determine accuracy, completeness, and relevance.

## Implementation Status Overview

The Mortgage Consultant Case Management System implementation shows good alignment with the PRD in several core areas, particularly in the case management, entity structure, and document management fundamentals. However, there are noticeable gaps in certain features, and some implementations don't fully match the PRD specifications.

### At a Glance:

- **Correctly Implemented**: ~70% of core features
- **Missing Components**: ~15% of required features
- **Mismatched Implementations**: ~10% of implemented features
- **Irrelevant Components**: ~5% of current implementation

## Correctly Implemented Components

### 1. Case Management

- **Case Creation and Overview**:
  - The basic case creation functionality is properly implemented with required fields
  - Case overview capabilities are present through `case_overview_router.py`
  - Cases can be searched and listed as required

- **New Case Wizard**:
  - The guided workflow for new case creation is implemented through `case_wizard_router.py` and `case_wizard_database.py`
  - The "Declaration" survey is correctly implemented to establish case structure as specified
  - Entity placeholders are created during the wizard process as required

### 2. Entity Management

- **Person and Company Management**:
  - Person creation with required fields (name, contact details, ID number, role)
  - Company creation with required fields (name, type, role, ID number)
  - Relationships between persons are implemented as specified

- **Financial Entity Management**:
  - Implementation of bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and assets
  - All required identifying fields are present
  - Association with persons as specified in the PRD

- **Employment and Income Management**:
  - Employment history tracking with employer name, position, type, dates
  - Income source tracking with source type and label
  - Properly derived employment history from work-type income sources

### 3. Document Management

- **Unique Document Types System**:
  - Implementation matches the PRD's specification for document type templates
  - All required fields are included (display name, category, target object, document type, etc.)
  - Appropriate frequency handling for recurring documents

- **Document Classification and Linkage**:
  - Documents can be linked to specific entities
  - Document classification according to defined types works as specified
  - The on-the-fly entity creation during document identification is implemented

- **Document Upload and Storage**:
  - Document upload functionality with proper file type and size validation (25MB limit)
  - Proper storage of files in server folder
  - Download and view capabilities

### 4. System Configuration

- **Dropdown Options System**:
  - The flexible system for maintaining dropdown options is correctly implemented
  - Options are organized by category as required
  - CRUD operations for dropdown options are available

## Missing Components

### 1. Document Management

- **Document History Tracking**:
  - The PRD specifies that for updatable documents, the system should keep a history, but the current implementation doesn't appear to have a clear mechanism for this
  - No versioning system is apparent for tracking document updates over time

### 2. Entity Management

- **Asset Tracking Enhancements**:
  - The PRD mentions viewing all financial entities in a case by type, but implementation for comprehensive filtering appears incomplete
  - There's no clear implementation for tracking multiple entities per person with proper categorization
  
- **Employment Date Tracking**:
  - Employment history includes current employer status but appears to be missing start and end date tracking as specified in the PRD
  - The employment_history table in the schema doesn't include the employment_since and employment_until fields mentioned in the PRD model

### 3. System Capabilities

- **Case Composition Dashboard**:
  - While the case overview functionality exists, there doesn't appear to be a comprehensive dashboard showing counts of persons, companies, and financial entities as specified
  - The summary statistics for the case overview mentioned in the PRD are not fully implemented

### 4. Data Migration Path

- **S3 Migration Plan**:
  - The PRD mentions a future migration to S3 for file storage, but there's no apparent preparation or abstraction layers to facilitate this migration

## Mismatched Implementations

### 1. Document Processing

- **Document Type Classification**:
  - The implementation includes advanced AWS Bedrock classification which is more complex than what the PRD specifies
  - The `detect_doc_type.py` introduces automated document classification whereas the PRD suggests a more manual process

### 2. Data Models

- **Schema Inconsistencies**:
  - Several database tables don't match the exact structure specified in the PRD data models
  - For example, the PRD specifies `employment_since` and `employment_until` fields in the employment history model, but these are missing in the actual database schema
  - Several extra fields exist in the database that weren't specified in the PRD models

### 3. API Structure

- **Endpoint Organization**:
  - The router organization doesn't fully align with the screen concepts outlined in the PRD
  - Some endpoints implement more granular functionality than what the PRD specifies

### 4. Document Management Workflow

- **Document Processing States**:
  - The implementation includes additional document processing states beyond what the PRD specifies
  - Tables like `processing_states` and `pending_processing_documents` suggest a more complex workflow than outlined in the PRD

## Irrelevant Components

### 1. Document Processing Feature

- **Automated Document Processing**:
  - The `docs_processing` feature module implements automated document processing using AWS services which isn't mentioned in the PRD
  - Components like `detect_doc_type.py` and the PDF parsing utilities go beyond the scope defined in the PRD

### 2. Monday Integration

- **Monday.com Integration**:
  - The schema includes a `cases_monday_relation` table and there are Monday-related models in the codebase
  - This integration isn't mentioned anywhere in the PRD

### 3. Extended User Management

- **User Profiles and Preferences**:
  - The user model contains many additional fields beyond what's necessary for the single mortgage consultant use case
  - Complex user preference handling and department tracking aren't mentioned in the PRD

### 4. Financial Organizations

- **Financial Organization Management**:
  - The `fin_orgs` and `fin_org_contacts` tables and related functionality aren't explicitly mentioned in the PRD
  - This appears to be a separate feature not specified in the requirements

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to align the implementation with the PRD specifications:

### 1. Implement Missing Features

- **Document History Tracking**: Add versioning capabilities for updatable documents
- **Employment Date Tracking**: Update the employment history schema to include start and end dates
- **Case Composition Dashboard**: Complete the case overview with entity counts and summaries

### 2. Refine Mismatched Implementations

- **Data Models**: Align database schema with the exact model specifications in the PRD
- **Document Workflow**: Simplify the document processing workflow to match the PRD specifications
- **API Organization**: Reorganize routers to better align with the screen concepts in the PRD

### 3. Remove Irrelevant Components

- **Automated Document Processing**: Consider removing or disabling the advanced AWS document classification if not required
- **Monday Integration**: Remove Monday.com integration components if not part of the requirements
- **Simplified User Management**: Scale back the user model to only what's needed for the single consultant use case

### 4. Documentation Updates

- **Update Implementation Documentation**: Create clear documentation for the implemented features
- **Clear Migration Path**: Document the planned path for S3 migration
- **API Reference**: Create a comprehensive API reference that aligns with the PRD specifications

By addressing these recommendations, the implementation will better align with the PRD requirements while maintaining the useful enhanced functionality that has been developed.
